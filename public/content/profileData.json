    "about": "Heyyyyooo \\\nI'm Sravan!!\n\nI started as an engineer, but I've always loved design. Solving problems and creating things that people enjoy using â€“ that's what excites me. So, I became a UX Designer. I worked with lots of startups, and eventually, I started my own design agency, WE Agency. WE help businesses create amazing experiences for their customers and build products from scratch.\n\nBut my passion for creating goes beyond the digital world. I'm a techie at heart, always curious about the latest gadgets and how they can improve our lives. And that curiosity extends to the world around me. I love to travel, and discover the unique flavors each place has to offer.\n\nRight now, I'm back to school and adding another dimension to my journey by pursuing a Masters in Business and Innovation at SCAD.",
